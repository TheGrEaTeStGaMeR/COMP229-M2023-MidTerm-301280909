                <p class="mission">
                    Thank you for considering us. Over a decade ago we created a business partnership that grew into a
                    friendship that the two of us never could've imagined. We pinch ourselves every day to be sure it's
                    real, because much of it feels
                    like a dream. All these years later we look back and think "where did the time go". Over the years
                    we
                    have grown in numbers as we have hired some of the best and most highly regarded agents in the
                    business
                    to join us on our journey. Together we have broken many records as we set a new standard for the
                    industry. <br><br> In many ways we feel as though we are just getting started. We have recently
                    expanded our
                    business into the LA and Miami markets, where after interviewing the best of the best we created
                    two-amazing teams of highly qualified agents, who have years of experience in these markets.
                    Together we
                    are growing with the sole mission to be the best at what we do so we can best serve you in all of
                    your
                    real estate needs. We hope you give us the opportunity to show you how we differ from the rest. We
                    look
                    forward to working with you.

                <h2>Natalia Stark</h2>
                <p class="aboutSec">
                    Natalia Stark is a savvy twenty-first century businesswoman who speaks with genuine enthusiasm
                    about the power of creating one's own destiny. Not only is she talking the talk, she is also walking
                    the walk with over $1 billion in real estate sold.
                    <br><br>
                    Following her introduction on the national stage from her success on the first season of The
                    Apprentice, Natalia has forayed her initial media exposure into a multitude of television
                    appearances, most notably as a real estate contributor on Fox News and her own television show on
                    the Style Network “Hot Miami Listings,” which she produced and starred in as well. “Hot Listings
                    Miami” became the number #1 rated show on the network and is still airing around the world. She has
                    also appeared and had properties featured on NBC, VH1, SITV, TOPPS TV, CNN, CNBC, ESPN, MTV,
                    Bloomberg TV and BBC.
                    <br><br>
                    Her career in real estate began when she “flipped” her first investment property at age seventeen.
                    Natalia garnered her first six-figure commission check while still a student at the University of
                    Miami, where she majored in International Finance and Marketing, and where she graduated with a 4.0
                    grade point average.

                    <p>
                        Natalia was recommended to us by a friend, and we're so grateful. She was an absolute joy to
                        work with, very responsive and very well connected in all facets of the real estate market. Her
                        connections helped make our entire buying process much smoother, and even still after closing
                        she's helping make our house a home. We've made a friend in Natalia and we highly recommend her
                        to anyone looking to buy or sell!

                        Natalia sold me my first apartment. It was an incredible and painless experience. After our
                        initial conversation she knew exactly the type of apartment I was looking for on Miami Beach.
                        Natalia was the best person to have on my side and was a savvy negotiator to get the seller to
                        sell at the price that was within my budget. She walked me through the closing and handed me a
                        glass of champagne with my keys. She treated me like I was a 5 million dollar client. A
                        wonderful person, a master realtor, and someone you can trust. Thank you Natalia!
                    </p>

                        Natalia is by far the best agent I have worked with. She made our move from Los Angeles to South
                        Florida super easy and smooth. She negotiated the absolute best price and got us the exact home
                        we wanted. She has extensive knowledge of the area. She even helped us find landscaper and
                        cleaning company. She is the most connected person in this arena. We will always use her for all
                        our real estate needs. Jacob Lapp
